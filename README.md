# JAVASCRIPT_STRING-OBJECT-METHODS
in the above codes i have used the following methods:

1. split()   - The split() method in JavaScript is used to split a string into an array of substrings based on a specified delimiter and returns the new array.
2. reverse() - The reverse() method reverses the elements of an array in place, meaning it modifies the original array without creating a new one. It reverses the order of the elements, so 
               the first element becomes the last, the second element becomes the second to last, and so on.
   
3. join()     - The join() method in JavaScript is used to join the elements of an array into a string. It takes an array and concatenates its elements into a single string. 
4. .toString  - In JavaScript, the toString() method is a built-in method that can be used on objects to convert them to a string representation.
